#********************************  Builing ******************************************
# Serverless Architecture Design
# I'm building a real-time chat application with high scalability requirements. Design a serverless architecture on GCP.

# Serverless Architecture Design
# what are the steps i would go through to deploy a python app to cloud run, with and identiy aware proxy




#********************************  Securing ******************************************

# Secure GKE Practices
# I have a GKE cluster running production workloads. Provide a security checklist and steps to harden the cluster, covering network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), secrets management, and vulnerability scanning.

# What IAM role should i give a user that want to run a query on Big Query

# Secure Coding Practices
# I'm developing a web application in Python using Flask. Provide a list of common security vulnerabilities specific to Flask applications and suggest best practices to mitigate them.



#********************************  Optimising ******************************************

# What are some options to reduce latency for my app end users 

# Cloud Run Deployment Optimization
# I have a containerized Python web application running on Cloud Run. Help me optimize its performance and cost-efficiency by analyzing current settings, suggesting appropriate instance types, concurrency, and scaling configurations.

# Data Encryption
# I need to store sensitive user data in a MySQL database. Explain the different encryption options available (at rest, in transit) and recommend the most suitable approach for my application, providing code examples.

# Cost vs. Performance Trade-offs
# I need to reduce my database costs without sacrificing query performance. Provide a guide exploring strategies like read replicas, caching, indexing, and query optimization, explaining the cost implications of each.
